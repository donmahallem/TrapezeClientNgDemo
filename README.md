# TrapezeClientNg Demo

This is a demo project showing [TrapezeClientNg](https://github.com/donmahallem/TrapezeClientNg) working for KVG in Kiel. This should also work for other public transportation services using a software product by Trapeze Group who is public to the internet for example like Krakow Public transport.

The Frontend does use a wrapper around a [Node Client Wrapper](https://github.com/donmahallem/TrapezeApiClientNode) behind this [Express Route](https://github.com/donmahallem/TrapezeApiExpressRoute). This is due to me not having all endpoints and some short comings of the api itself and problems arising from missing cors headers etc.

Feel free to open issues if you got questions.
